In problem arising in computer science, mathematics, engineering, and many
other disciplines we often need to represent arbitrary relationship among
data objects. Directed and undirected graphs are natural models of such
relationships. This chapter presents the basic data structures that can be
used to represent directed graphs. Some basic algorithms for determining the
connectivity of directed graphs and for finding shortest path are also
presented.
